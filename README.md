# CryptopalsChallenges
I am uploading my solutions to cryptopals crypto challenges (https://cryptopals.com/). These challenges are targeted at anyone who wants to learn cryptography by purely problem solving.

The solutions are not yet complete (as of Feb 2023), but I will keep updating them as I work on it. Most of the functions that are used repeatedly are included in `helper.py` and filenames for challenges are self explanatory.

At some point, I hope to also make a writeup on some of the interesting questions that were particularly tough to solve.
